India is starting to experiment with blockchain technology, specifically in digital payment efficiency.

Starting on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of India is launching a pilot program to test its digital rupee. This is a special currency for specific use cases, like with banks and other financial institutions. It will start in the wholesale segment of the economy, which includes many important transactions like securities settlement and cross-currency payments.

The purpose of this pilot program is to define the process for settling secondary market transactions in government securities.

Officials with the central bank are testing a digital rupee, which would be integrated with the financial system. They're trying to find if it can help make the interbank market more efficient, reduce transaction costs and eliminate settlement risk.

The software will be tested, then expanded to a number of other transactions and cross-border payments utilizing knowledge learned from the upcoming launch

9 banks will be participating in the pilot test, some of those banks are as following ; HSBC, ICICI Bank, Union Bank of India and HDFC Bank.

The central bank has announced that they plan on launching a digital currency pilot. This will only be available for select customers and merchants, with the pilot starting in the retail sector within the next month. The date and details about this project will be announced at a later date.
