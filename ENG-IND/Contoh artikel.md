How Would Crypto Look Without Centralized Exchanges Like FTX?

What if all centralized crypto exchanges disappeared, leaving only DeFi?

There is no doubt that crypto isn't dead (yet). Or at least the crypto that exists outside of a particular three-letter centralized crypto exchange isn't dead either.

In addition to providing a harsh lesson for many, the collapse of FTX also raises an interesting question for DeFi (which some argue is the only real crypto in existence): what would crypto look like without exchanges?

First, let's examine the components of an average crypto exchange, or rather their consumer services.

A very reasonable price allows users to swap Bitcoin for Ethereum, Cardano for Solana, and many other non-compatible cryptocurrencies.

There are few concerns about congestion and so forth when it comes to trading on exchanges, but there has been plenty of downtime in the past.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, they make it easy to link your bank account to the crypto markets, giving traders easy access to their chips.

Basically, we're talking about interoperability, scalability, and onboarding. And don't forget, they're typically designed to be friendly to newbies.

There are some green shoots in the DeFi world, but the sector still has a long way to go before it can compete in the same arenas and onboard newcomers.

The Hop Protocol is one such example, but it is limited to Ethereum, Gnosis, and layer-2 solutions, so there is certainly hope that a robust design will emerge. A popular cross-chain protocol that connects layer-1 and layer-2 networks, Synapse, is another. Of course, these are just examples, and a bridge is only as trustworthy as its last attack.

Additionally, THORchain is working on cross-chain swaps using a slightly different design.

For the normies in the audience, swapping non-compatible assets isn't nearly as easy in DeFi as it is on a centralized exchange.

Keep it short and sweet

Crypto has been quiet these days, and gas fees are at record lows, but don't forget: with every bull market or catastrophe, those fees go up a lot.

As the bull market dwindled, so too did gas fees. Can you guess when Terra imploded?
