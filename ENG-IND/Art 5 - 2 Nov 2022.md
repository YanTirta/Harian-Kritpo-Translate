Even as the value of NFTs plummet, museums are reaching out to digital artists.

Digital art has been out of favor for decades, but it's now receiving a warm reception from major curators looking to embrace new audiences and retain wealthy donors who has a ever growing appetite for NFTs.

For the holiday season, The Museum of Modern Art's lobby will be illuminated not with twinkling lights, but with a digital artist's graphics who increased in popularity during the speculation around NFTs.

One of the key contributors to MoMA's success is a partnership with Anadol, a Turkish American artist and curator. They looked into collaborating on NFTs and they have an impressive track record. One even sold for $200,000! Plus, MoMa would earn 17% of primary sales and 5% of secondary sales from these transactions. Finally, this is not only financially beneficial but also a smart business move because their attendance decreased from about 3 million to 1.65 million due to last year's pandemic.

The sharp decline of the NFT market is already impacting the way digital art is grouped under a single term. Some artists and curators are avoiding the term because they are frustrated at its association with speculation and scamming. Others complain that marketers have used this abbreviation as an all-inclusive label over the past two years, erroneously lumping together different types of digital art to take advantage of the bull market.
