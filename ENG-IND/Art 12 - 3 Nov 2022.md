A sign crypto is becoming ever more prominent is the efforts of BlackRock's European blockchain ETF

As the crypto market has traded sideways over the past year, institutional interest in the asset class has continued to climb as more options become available to gain access in a regulatory-compliant way.

BlackRock, a multinational investment company, has announced the launch of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) that offers investors exposure to blockchain and crypto companies for European users.

Through their official website, the following statement is shared, "The new fund is designed for investors wanting exposure to a wide variety of companies that are involved in the development, innovation, and utilization of blockchain and crypto technologies."

This move was characterized as "more than noteworthy" by Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of Flowdesk for BlackRock's ETF is expanding to accommodate and integrate a broader spectrum of digital assets.

“It’s not just bitcoin anymore – although bitcoin is incredibly important for this industry,” Chaumont said. “It’s a whole host of other blockchain companies and related technologies that are being recognized as transformative for global finance and digital technology more broadly.”

The Flowdesk CEO further laments the effort of BlackRock will have a positive impact towards the development of both crypto and blockchain. "With the world's largest asset manager committing more and more to digital assets, you can be sure that everyone - including regulators - is paying close attention to blockchain," he noted.

European Union officials may be warming up to the potential of digital assets like Bitcoin for it is suggested that the blockchain ETF “comes at the right time to confirm the legitimacy of the digital asset industry,” and “highlights the massive opportunities that blockchain holds.”

Potential impact of legislation development

Though Chaumont believes that BlackRock's new product has helped create a positive environment for Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), he also said that direct impacts will be difficult to measure due to the high level of complexity in EU decision-making.
