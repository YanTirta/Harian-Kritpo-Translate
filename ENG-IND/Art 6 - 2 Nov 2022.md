Visa is holding a football NFT auction in advance of the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar.

The Visa Masters of Movement is a new auction on Crypto.com of digital art by five legendary footballers, made into NFTs. Give your bids now to own a stake of these iconic goals and forever immortalize your favorite player.

Take a deep dive into the world of digital art with asset tokenization at an interactive pitch at the FIFA Fan Festival in Doha, Qatar. At this upcoming event, you'll see how NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, can be used to create a new digital art form through you own movements.

Eligible fans will have the chance to mint their own digital art, with the help of Crypto.com, an official sponsor of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022.

As the FIFA World Cup approaches, Visa is celebrating football, art and technology by reflecting on what makes this event special. Besides fiercely enthusiastic fans and legendary athletes, the FIFA World Cup also unites people from all over the globe for a few fleeting weeks in a uniquely connected way.

Crypto.com is holding the Visa Masters of Movement auction where the highest bidder for each rare NFT will receive it and a signed memorabilia from the featured player.

All auction proceeds will be donated to Street Child United, a charitable non-profit operating in the United Kingdom. Their mission is to tackle and end the stigma against street-connected children globally.
