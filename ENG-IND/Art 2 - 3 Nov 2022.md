Dubai is combining advanced technology and blockchain in order to make the city a hub of AI and Web3, according to Emirates News Agency (WAM).

Dubai is a global hub for emerging technologies like the metaverse and blockchain. The city has an estimated 1,000 companies and is attracting more businesses all the time. Current contributions of the sector is $500 million and is estimated to grow to $4 billion in five years. Dubai's plan is to support more than 40,000 virtual jobs by 2030 through the Dubai Metaverse Strategy.

A committee will develop policies, analyze trends, and supervise the implementation of strategies related to the digital economy, future technologies, and more. The committee will also include members with experience in metaverse, AI, blockchain, Web3, VR and AR and other supporting expertise.

Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) just implemented the Test-Adapt-Scale model to help the city become a global leader in emerging technologies. The model is a magnet for high-value, technology-driven companies looking to relocate. This could help Dubai become one of the top 10 metaverse economies while also taking a lead on blockchain adoption.
