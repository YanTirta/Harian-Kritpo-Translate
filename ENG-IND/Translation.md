Tweet by Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, caused Dogecoin to spike followed suit by scammers.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken over Twitter and some are hoping that will be an adoption of Dogecoin. The cryptocurrency has nearly doubled in value since Musk took over the social media company Friday.

Elon Musk tweet on Halloween night helped DOGE to jump nearly 24%. A result of posting the mascot of DOGE wearing a Twitter t-shirt followed with a wink. However, these numbers have settled a little bit this morning.

Scammers seize the opportunity in Elon's Tweet.

Around 169 dodgy cryptocurrencies took opportunity after Musk's tweet, many of which are named Dogecoin, Twitter, Elon or some combination. 45 have lost all their value and 42 can't be traded back out. This is according to data from the PeckShield security firm.

DOGE Rally

Dogecoin has enjoyed a strong rally in the stock market lately due to Elon Musk takeover, reaching its highest point since last May. At that time it reached up to 73 cents but by July it fell below 20 cents.
