In order to stay ahead of the curve, Nissan filed for 5 trademarks.

It appears that car manufacturer Nissan has filed five trademark applications for some of its most iconic models. The company is also planning to enter the NFT space, with NFTs, NFT-backed media, online NFT marketplaces, digital wallets and NFT minting software.

In official filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Metaverse's attorney has disclosed trademark registrations for NFT authentication and patents for trading cards, tickets, artwork, music files and video.

The Nissan cars reported to be part of this pending application include models like the GTR, SKYLINE, and Z. Downloadable computer software will also be released, according to the filling. Digital wallets that can access and transfer NFTs (non-fungible tokens) via a secure online marketplace will also be included.

Nissan recently teamed up with Australian video game company Monkey Grease and it's taking it one step further.

Grease Monkey and Nissan are committed to the quality of the NFT vehicles and their parts. They want them to be as real-life-like as possible.

Other car manufacturers that have launched NFTs are Lamborghini, Porsche, Rolls-Royce, Lykan and Ferrari.

A number of traditional and web3 companies have begun deploying their products using NFTs, demonstrating the power of the technology and how it can redefine businesses, operations, economies, and social interactions.
