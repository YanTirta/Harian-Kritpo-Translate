Game of Thrones will have NFTs in an annoucement by Warner Bros. Discovery and HBO

HBO and WBD are teaming up with Nifty to launch digital-collectible non-fungible tokens based on the hit series “Game of Thrones.” An official release date has not yet been confirmed, but fans will be able to get their hands on them in late 2022.

Game of Thrones fans can now build their own kingdom in NFT's newest experience. They will collect customizable avatars--inspired by characters from the series--via pack openings and use these avatars to collect assets used to build their empire like weapons, companions, and gear. WBD further noted that "various themed packs" would be sold through the program.

Other Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) will feature moments and locations from Game of Thrones, as well as characters. Fans will also be able to enjoy a variety of thematic activities and on-site engagement.

The company didn't reveal pricing.

When asked about the future of the new digital content, Josh Hackbarth, Head of NFT Commercial Development at Warner Bros. Discovery has said this is their goal: to allow fans to create new ways for them to interact with the stories and characters they love. In addition, they're excited to offer a unique digital collectible program that will engage fans on a deeper level and enhance the overall fan experience.
