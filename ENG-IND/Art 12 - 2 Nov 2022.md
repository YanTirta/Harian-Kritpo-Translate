ADNOC and Siemens Energy have agreed to develop blockchain-based low-CO2 energy certificates.

Through collaboration, ADNOC is exploring digital certification of its low-carbon Murban crude, ammonia, and aviation fuels.

Demonstrated in a pilot project with ADNOC, the continuous monitoring of gas transfer data and product transportation across the companyâ€™s operational chain will show how much carbon dioxide was used to produce products. This information will be automatically recorded onto a decentralized blockchain ledger.

Transparency is essential for rating and certifying products, which will give consumers better clarity and confidence over the products they buy.

When people typically hear the word "blockchain," they think of crypto currency. Yet, this technology has implications for fields other than finance, including oil and gas. The pilot ADNOC is embarking on promises to show the world how the resulting low-carbon energy influences the environment and why ADNOC gas is among the least carbon intensive in oil and gas production.

In ADNOC's latest memorandum of understanding with Siemens, the two companies hope to collaborate and accelerate decarbonization. ADNOC will provide its state-of-the-art innovation facility in Abu Dhabi, as well as experts from other areas to work on green hydrogen technologies and more.
