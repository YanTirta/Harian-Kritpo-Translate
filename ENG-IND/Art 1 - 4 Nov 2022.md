Twitter Plans To Go Crypto On Hold

Fans of Dogecoin were banking on a crypto wallet being integrated into Twitter, but recent reports indicate that there has been a delay in the project.

The alleged transformation of Twitter to becoming a crypto wallet unexpectedly has take a turn from what the Dogecoin community hoped for.

According to reports, Elon Musk once teased the idea of integrating Dogecoin into Twitter through a mischievous tweet. There are even reports Elon has told employees that cryptocurrency payments would be the company's priority.

Last week acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk sparked a frenzy. Many in the crypto industry was looking forward to this move, there were even a $500 million injection by investors that was looking forward for the natural progression of Twitter to be more crypto friendly. New reports have come forth that say otherwise. It seems as though Musk's focus was more on things that mattered to him rather than trying to make the site better for crypto

Leading up to Musk's purchase of Twitter, noted tech leak Jane Manchun Wong has tweeted that the company is working on a "wallet prototype" with cryptocurrency deposit and withdrawal capabilities. Wong is known for sharing top-notch leaks from high-profile social media accounts and her expertise often turns out to be accurate.
