This 13-year-old Egyptian is building his own metaverse out of his mother's old clothes.

Straight out of Hollywood, the Spielberg film Ready Player One planted the idea of building a virtual world in 13-year-old Omar Wael's mind.

Growing up, Wael always had a real passion for technology and artificial intelligence (AI).

The ambitious young teen even built his first robot when he was only nine years old.

When he watched the Spielberg film, which explores a future where most of humanity lives in a computer-generated world, he became interested in virtual social worlds--or metaverses.

It wasn't too long after that Wael began to develop something of his own.


With his mother's old clothes, Wael developed a sensory vest and glove. He is also developing software that will help other students like himself attend classes with the help of immersive worlds.

When the metaverse became more accessible due to companies investing billions into it, his idea really started coming into its own.

"This saves the environment, reduces traffic," he explained.

"Researchers who work on chemical experiments won't have to buy expensive chemical material, they can simply carry out their experiments in a virtual lab in a simulation of what happens in reality exactly".

Wael won various awards for his project, “The Other World.” From this project he will seek funding to keep creating and developing it.
