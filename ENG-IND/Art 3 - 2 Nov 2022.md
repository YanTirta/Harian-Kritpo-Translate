Citizenships can now be purchased as NFTs on the Marketplace.

A great deal of unique things and pieces have been sold on the blockchain. For example, an artist sold the burned and charred remains of a Lamborghini Huracan in February 2022 and British artist Damien Hirst burned hundreds of artworks he'd already sold. Now, citizenships are being sold as standardized Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for purchase and trade on marketplaces.

An Island Only For Crypto

South Pacific island Lataro Island is planning to become a haven for cryptocurrency investors. The ambitious development project will convert the island into a sustainable, smart city. Property developers Anthony and Theresa Welsh are at the helm of this vision.

Anthony Welch said their ultimate goal is to create a community of crypto investors that live on the island. According to him, the biggest draw will be the lack of income taxes you'll face while living there. To live on the island, an individual needs 21000 tokens called a passport and they're currently being sold on digital marketplaces.

NFTs are tokens that represent pieces of property also exclusive access to the new island. For those who don't want citizenship, the developer has plans for a resort so crypto investors can enjoy the island without investing.

So far, Citizenship Passes have generated nearly 1,000 ETH of volume since they were first made available on OpenSea.
